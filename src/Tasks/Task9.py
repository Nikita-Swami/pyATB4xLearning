### Task #9
#âœ… FizzBuzz Test:
#Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. # Loop For
#However, for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and

#For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."

for num in range(1, 101):
    if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 != 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif num % 5 == 0 and num % 3 != 0:
        print("Buzz")
    elif num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:
